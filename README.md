# Exploring-Trends-in-American-Baby-Names
This project explores over a century of American baby naming preferences using data from the United States Social Security Administration, spanning 1920 through 2020. Understanding naming trends provides valuable insights for parents making naming decisions while demonstrating applicable analytical skills for trend analysis across various business and cultural domains. Using the baby_names dataset containing first names, gender, and count of babies given each name annually, the analysis identifies names that have remained consistently popular for over 100 years, distinguishes between classic names (like Aaron and James) and trendy names (like Aaliyah and Adam), and tracks how naming preferences have evolved across decades. The project reveals top-ranking names by era, recognizes names experiencing resurgence in popularity, and provides a comprehensive view of how American parental preferences have shifted over the past century, offering both cultural insights and practical analytics experience in trend analysis and popularity ranking.​
